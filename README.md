1. It's been a while since I did anything CLI related so I asked AI to generate me skeleton structure of a program that accepts command line arguments. My first guess would have been to use the 'clap' library which I was familiar with, but AI pushed me to use 'std::env::args' instead, since it is zero dependency and sufficient for this task.

2. I then asked AI to generate me some code using the csv line by line reader for a sample of the input file. AI created a 'Transaction' struct using String for the transaction type and raw integers for the IDs. To better take advantage of the Rust type system, I created an Enum for the transaction types, and newtypes for the IDs. I have used the 'csv' library many times before in the past, but I like having AI generate me the boilerplate, easier than modifying code from my other projects.
