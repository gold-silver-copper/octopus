AI Disclosure Notes:

1. It's been a while since I did anything CLI related so I asked AI to generate me skeleton structure of a program that accepts command line arguments. My first guess would have been to use the 'clap' library which I was familiar with, but AI pushed me to use 'std::env::args' instead, since it is zero dependency and good enough for this task.
